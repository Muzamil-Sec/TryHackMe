Basic Networking Concepts

1. Network
A network is a collection of connected devices (computers, servers, routers, switches) that share data and resources.

2. IP Address
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to every device on a network. It helps devices communicate with each other.

3. MAC Address
A MAC address is a hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card. It is used for communication inside a local network.

4. Router
A router connects different networks together and forwards data between them. It decides the best path for data to travel.

5. Switch
A switch connects multiple devices within the same network and forwards data based on MAC addresses.

6. DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses so browsers can access websites.

7. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network.

8. Subnet
A subnet is a smaller segment of a larger network used to improve performance and security.

9. Firewall
A firewall filters incoming and outgoing traffic to protect the network from unauthorized access.

10. Protocols
Protocols are rules that define how data is transmitted across a network. Common protocols include TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SMTP.
