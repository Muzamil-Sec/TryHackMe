Network Scanning and Nmap Summary

Today, I focused on understanding the concepts of host discovery, port scanning, and different scanning techniques using Nmap and related tools. The session began with learning about live host discovery. Before performing a port scan, it is essential to identify which systems are online to avoid wasting time scanning inactive hosts. Host discovery can be performed using ARP scans, ICMP scans, and TCP/UDP ping scans.

An ARP scan uses Address Resolution Protocol to discover live hosts on the same subnet. It works by sending ARP requests to a network segment asking for the MAC address associated with a specific IP. Only devices on the same subnet can respond to ARP queries. ICMP scans use ping requests to identify live hosts by sending ICMP Echo Request packets and waiting for Echo Reply packets. TCP/UDP ping scans send packets to common TCP or UDP ports to determine if a host responds, which indicates that it is live. Tools such as arp-scan and masscan are commonly used for quick discovery of active hosts on a network.

I also reviewed the concepts of network segments and subnets. A network segment is a group of computers connected through a common medium, such as a switch or WiFi access point. A subnet is a logical grouping of multiple segments connected via a router, often defined by a subnet mask such as /24 or /16. The subnet mask determines the number of possible hosts in that subnet. During active reconnaissance, it is crucial to identify which devices are live in the subnet before initiating further scans.

Next, I learned about port concepts. Just as an IP address identifies a host on a network, a TCP or UDP port identifies a service running on that host. Common examples include web servers on ports 80 and 443, SSH on port 22, and email services on ports 25, 110, or 143. Ports can be classified as open, closed, filtered, unfiltered, open|filtered, or closed|filtered. Open ports have a service listening, closed ports are accessible but have no service, filtered ports cannot be reached due to firewall rules, and unfiltered ports are accessible but the status is unknown. Combined states occur when Nmap cannot conclusively determine whether a port is open or filtered or closed or filtered.

I also learned about TCP and UDP scanning techniques. The TCP header contains flags such as URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN, which control the connection state. TCP connect scans complete the full three-way handshake by sending a SYN, receiving SYN/ACK, sending ACK, and then tearing down the connection with RST/ACK. This scan is available to unprivileged users. TCP SYN scans, however, only send SYN packets and respond with RST once SYN/ACK is received. This method is stealthier and is the default for privileged users. UDP scans are connectionless and rely on receiving ICMP port unreachable messages to identify closed ports. Open UDP ports often do not reply, making their status sometimes unclear.

Finally, I learned about port selection and scan speed control in Nmap. Ports can be selected individually using -p, in ranges, or all 65535 ports using -p-. Fast scans (-F) or top ports (--top-ports) allow for quicker enumeration. Timing templates (-T0 to -T5) control speed, ranging from very slow and stealthy to very fast and aggressive. Packet rates can also be manually controlled using --min-rate and --max-rate, while probe parallelization can be set with --min-parallelism and --max-parallelism. These options help balance stealth, speed, and accuracy depending on the target environment.

Overall, I now have a strong understanding of host discovery, port scanning types, TCP/UDP protocols, port states, and Nmap scanning techniques. I am confident in using Nmap for practical network enumeration while managing scan speed, stealth, and precision.
